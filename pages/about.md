## About the Collection

This collection was created as a capstone project for LBSC671: Creating Information Infrastructures. It consists of photos of my immediate and extended family members taken between 2003 and 2014 during holidays, family vacations, and other events.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
